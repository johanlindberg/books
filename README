Annotated Turing
================

Introduction
------------
I wrote this code because I wanted to try out the examples from the book The
Annotated Turing (http://www.theannotatedturing.com/) by Charles Petzold.

There are several examples of Turing Machines described in the book. I've
arranged them according to chapter and which page the description *starts* at.

I've tried to stay as close as possible to the descriptions used in the book
without getting silly about it. Most notably the operations, which are specified
in the book as P1,R,R are represented here as ((P 1) (R) (R)) instead. I've also
added a . before the name of a configuration if it otherwise would have clashed
with an available tape operation.

Usage
-----
If you're using Slime, simply C-x C-f /path/to/ch5.lisp, C-c C-k to load and
compile.

; SLIME 2008-09-22
CL-USER> 
;;;; Compile file /Users/johanlindberg/Projects/annotated-turing/ ...
;Compiling "/Users/johanlindberg/Projects/annotated-turing/ch5.lisp"...
;Loading #P"/Users/johanlindberg/Projects/annotated-turing/ch5.dx64fsl"...

p81 is a macro that constructs the example from chapter 5, page 81.

CL-USER> (pprint (macroexpand-1 '(p81)))

(PROGN (M-CONFIGURATION .B (NONE ((P 0) (R)) .C))
       (M-CONFIGURATION .C (NONE ((R)) .E))
       (M-CONFIGURATION .E (NONE ((P 1) (R)) .F))
       (M-CONFIGURATION .F (NONE ((R)) .B))
       (MAKE-TURING-MACHINE :STARTING-STATE '.B)); No value

Invoking (p81) results in a fresh Turing Machine, and a blank tape, with the
configurations .B (starting-state), .C, .E and .F available to it.

CL-USER> (p81)
NEXT

The function next is used to step through the program. It performs the
operations specified for the state (current configuration and symbol on tape) it
is currently in and prints the whole tape, the number of steps performed so far
and what the next configuration is. _ represents a blank square and ^ indicates
the position of the head.

CL-USER> (next)

TAPE: 0_  NEXT: .C
       ^  STEP: 1
NIL

You can also step forward several states before printing.

CL-USER> (next 3)
TAPE: 0_1__  NEXT: .B
          ^  STEP: 4
NIL
CL-USER> (next 50)
TAPE: 0_1_0_1_0_1_0_1_0_1_0_1_0_1_0_1_0_1_0_1_0_1_0_1_0_1_0__  NEXT: .E
                                                            ^  STEP: 54
NIL

A walk-through of chapter 6
---------------------------
Let's try something a little more complicated. In chapter 6, page 102, there's
a machine that calculates the square root of 2 in binary. Let's assume that
you're *not* using Slime and instead load this program the "hard" way.

CL-USER> (compile-file "~/Projects/annotated-turing/ch6.lisp")
#P"/Users/johanlindberg/Projects/annotated-turing/ch6.dx64fsl"
NIL
NIL
CL-USER> (load "~/Projects/annotated-turing/ch6")
#P"/Users/johanlindberg/Projects/annotated-turing/ch6.dx64fsl"
CL-USER> (p102)
NEXT

The book's description of how this program works assumes that it already has
performed 408 steps. 

CL-USER> (next 408) ; page 102
TAPE: @1_0_1_____________  NEXT: NEW
      ^                    STEP: 408
NIL

The next time the tape is shown is when mark-digits has done it's work, which
takes another 5 steps.

CL-USER> (next 5) ; page 103
TAPE: @1X0X1X_Z_R________  NEXT: FIND-X
                ^          STEP: 413
NIL

The machine requires another 51 steps to get to the state when it is next shown.

CL-USER> (next 51) ; page 103
TAPE: @1_0_1__Z_R_R_R_R_R_R_R  NEXT: FIND-DIGITS
      ^                        STEP: 464
NIL

The rest of the tape "snapshots" are at 8, 11, 20, 4, 20, 3, 22.

CL-USER> (next 8) ; page 105
TAPE: @1_0_1__Z_V_R_R_R_R_R_R  NEXT: ADD-FINISHED
                ^              STEP: 472
NIL
